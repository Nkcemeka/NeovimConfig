# Nvim Setup
This is my personal neovim setup. It contains my personal code, ideas and others gotten from the web. </br>
I won't say this repo offers a fully-featured IDE, but at least it offers linting, syntax-checking, </br>
autocompletion etc. I will add more with time if I feel it is useful. 

## Answers to Prospective Questions
- Feel free to use my repo to startup your neovim journey
- If you are confused about anything, shoot me an email [here](mailto:nkcemeka@gmail.com)

## Notes
- The code is littered with comments. I use that to help me understand. 
- The current repo offers functionality for Python and C++. I will add more with time
- If there is anything I should include here that would be of help, let me know!
