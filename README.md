# Nvim Setup
This is my personal neovim setup. It contains my personal code, ideas and other tips gotten from the web. </br>
I won't say this repo offers a fully-featured IDE, but at least it offers linting, syntax-checking, auto- </br>
completion etc. I will add more with time if I feel it is useful.

- The current repo offers functionality for Python and C++. I will add more with time
